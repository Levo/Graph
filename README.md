# Graph applet

This graph applet allows the user to create a variety graphs with the ability to add/remove nodes and edges. Also the user is allowed to set edge weights.

In addition to creating graphs you can run several graph traversal algorithms, i.g. DFS, BFS, prims, Kruskals.

After running the traversals there is an option to highlight the minimum spanning tree and cross/disovery edges are labeled.
